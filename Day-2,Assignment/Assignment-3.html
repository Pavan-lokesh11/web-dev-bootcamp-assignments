	<h1>THE BROOK</h1>	
	<p style="text-align:justify;">

From childhood's hour I have not been<br/><br/>As others were; I have not seen<br/><br/>As others saw; I could not bring<br/>My passions from a common spring.<br/><br/>From the same source I have not taken<br/><br/>My sorrow; I could not awaken<br/><br/>My heart to joy at the same tone;
